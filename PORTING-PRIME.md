# WATERMEDIA 2.1.x to 3.0.0-alpha.0
Everything was removed and rebuilded from scratch.

## Removed
- ImageAPI
- PlayerAPI
- NetworkAPI
- CacheAPI

## MediaAPI
Replaces ImageAPI, PlayerAPI, NetworkAPI and CacheAPI. This new API deals with pictures as a
"video" with no audio, or more like an animated texture, so you don't have to handle renderables as a different type of media.
Also, centralizes all media player implementations under the ``MediaPlayer.class``, working as a OpenGL/OpenAL
manager, avoiding class redundancy by using player capabilities (for audio and video) and focus the actual class
in the engine implementation.

MediaPlayer constructor explained
``MediaPlayer player = new MediaPlayer(URI, Thread, Executor, boolean, boolean)``
1. URI: the URI of the media, you can make one using ``URI.create()``
2. Thread: the render thread, usually ``Thread.currentThread()`` if you're on the render thread
3. Executor: the executor for the provided thread, so the player can perform method calls on render thread for OpenGL, In minecraft the executor is the Minecraft instance, so using ``Minecraft.getInstance()`` its enough
4. boolean (1): enables Video Capabilities
5. boolean (2): enables Audio Capabilities

Current available implementations are
- ``FFMediaPlayer``
- ``PicturePlayer`` (this one skips boolean (2) argument)
- ``VLMediaPlayer``

If you don't want or mind to figure out which player to use,
you can use the ``MediaAPI.createPlayer(URI, Thread, Executor, boolean, boolean)`` method 

Example:
```java
public void create() {
    var uri = Uri.create("https://files.catbox.moe/uxypnp.mp4");
    var mediaPlayer = MediaAPI.createPlayer(uri, Thread.currentThread(), Minecraft.getInstance(), true, true);
    mediaPlayer.start();    
}
```

## RENDERING
To render the texture, you need to run your own vertex logic,
blit or fill, you can get the texture id using ``player.texture()``.

For modern versions of Minecraft (1.20.1 and 1.21.1) you should make a ``TextureWrapper``
```java
package me.example.modder;

import net.minecraft.client.renderer.texture.AbstractTexture;
import net.minecraft.server.packs.resources.ResourceManager;
import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull;

public class TextureWrapper extends AbstractTexture {
    public TextureWrapper(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override public int getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    @Override public void load(@NotNull ResourceManager manager) { /* NO OP */ }
    @Override public void releaseId() { /* NO OP */ }
    @Override public void close() { /* NO OP */}
}
```
and register it to the texture manager
```java
var texture = new TextureWrapper(player.texture());
Minecraft.getInstance().getTextureManager().register("modid:myvideo", texture);
```

## CUSTOM GLSTATE
When your environment (minecraft 1.20.1+) is using a custom GLState,
it may be required to override watermedia's internal glstate (none) and set it before rendering the video texture.
You can do this by using the ``RenderAPI.setCustomGlManager(org.watermedia.api.render.support.GLManager)`` method, which will be called before rendering the video texture.

# PURPOSE OF THIS ALPHA
Purpose its found any potential bug/edge case on the players implementation and fix it, receive feedback of the
current `MediaPlayer.class` methods and if some should be added, removed or renamed, specially for the `FFMediaPlayer.class`.

Some other features remains unimplemented yet. But will be available in next alphas
